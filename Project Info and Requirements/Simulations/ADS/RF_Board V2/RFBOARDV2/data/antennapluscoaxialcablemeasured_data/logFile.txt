SP SP1[1] <RFBOARDV2_lib:antennapluscoaxialcablemeasured:schematic>   freq=(10 MHz->3 GHz)
Warning detected by hpeesofsim during SP analysis `SP1'.
    Data in the Touchstone file `C:/Users/bglau/OneDrive/Spring Term 24 25/ECE 413/antennaplustwoinchcoaxialcable_noportexension.s1p'
    does not cover the requested value of `freq'.
