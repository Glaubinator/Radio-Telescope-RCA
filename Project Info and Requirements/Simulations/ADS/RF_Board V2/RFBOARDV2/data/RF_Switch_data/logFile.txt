SP SP2[1] <RFBOARDV2_lib:RF Switch:schematic>   freq=(10 MHz->3 GHz)
Warning detected by hpeesofsim during SP analysis 'SP2'.
    Value(0.060321) <= MinLegalValue(0.100000) OR Value >= MaxLegalValue(10.000000) for 'W2/W1' in `Step5'


Warning detected by hpeesofsim during SP analysis `SP2'.
    Data in the Touchstone file `C:/Users/bglau/OneDrive/Spring Term 24 25/ECE 413/antennaplustwoinchcoaxialcable_noportexensionandnoVNAcable.s1p'
    does not cover the requested value of `freq'.
    Therefore, the required data was obtained by extrapolation.
