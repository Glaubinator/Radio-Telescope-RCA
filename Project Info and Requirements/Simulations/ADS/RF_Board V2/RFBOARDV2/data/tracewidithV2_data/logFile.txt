    Number of nodes with only one device attached (topology corrected): 2


SP SP2[1] <RFSWITCHBOARDINCHES:tracewidithV2:schematic>   freq=(10 MHz->3 GHz)
Warning detected by hpeesofsim during SP analysis `SP2'.
    Data in the Touchstone file `C:/Users/bglau/OneDrive/Spring Term 24 25/ECE 413/antennaplustwoinchcoaxialcable_noportexensionandnoVNAcable.s1p'
    does not cover the requested value of `freq'.
    Therefore, the required data was obtained by extrapolation.
