The details can be found in file 'C:\Users\bglau\OneDrive\Spring Term 24 25\ECE 413\RF_Board V2\RFBOARDV2\data\_1.6_GHz_Matching_Networks_data\spare_removal.txt'.

Warning detected by hpeesofsim in topology check during circuit set up.
    Number of nodes with only one device attached (topology corrected): 3


SP SP2[1] <RFBOARDV2_lib:1.6 GHz Matching Networks:schematic>   freq=(10 MHz->3 GHz)
Warning detected by hpeesofsim during SP analysis `SP2'.
    Data in the Touchstone file `C:/Users/bglau/OneDrive/Spring Term 24 25/ECE 413/RF MEasurements 1/remeasuringantenna.s1p'
    does not cover the requested value of `freq'.
    Therefore, the required data was obtained by extrapolation.
