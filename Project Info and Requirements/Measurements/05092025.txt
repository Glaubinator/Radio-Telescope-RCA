1420 MHz Testing
Just LNA with Cable:

Output = -7.041 dBm
Injected Signal = -21.36 dBm
500Khz Span
Noise Floor = -65dBm

System LNA, Filter and Cables (Coaxial Connector Adapter)

Output = -7.69 dBm
Injected Signal = -21.36 dBm
500Khz Span
Noise Floor = -65dBm




500 MHz Testing

System LNA, Filter and Cables (Coaxial Connector Adapter)

Output = -18.05 dBm
Injected Signal = -18.7 dBm
500kHz Span
Noise Floor = -85 dBm



New Test With Antenna, LNA, Filter , Cables( Coaxial Adapter)

2.2 GHz Test
Injected Signal = -23.05 dBm (-9dB nanoVNA setting)
20 MHz Span
Gain from Mini (s -param file only) = 11.83 dB
Return Loss Testing Monopole Antenna (Transimitting) @ 2.2 GHz = -6 dB
Signal Transmitted from Antenna (Including return loss) = -30 dBm

Receiving -52.21 dBm from 10 inches away.
Receiving Antenna Alone Signal : -39.56 dBm from 10 inches away.
Monopole Antenna Gain is around 5.2 dBi assumption (typical 2-5 dBi)
